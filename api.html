	<p>The API I chose is a simple database containing all the Lord of the Rings books,
	their chapters, and a search function for quotes. This information is not 
	available without authentication however, only the book titles are available</p>

	<p>I found this API on apilist.fun at https://the-one-api.herokuapp.com/</p>

	<p>Here, I simply made a new XMLHttpRequest, opened it with the GET command, 
		and put the response text into a var, which I paresed into a JSON object. 
		I displayed the data using this object.</p>

	<p>This API would be useful if you were trying to make a website that displayed 
		information about the Lord of the Rings and you needed to quickly fetch
		it from an already existing database. It would also be useful if you 
		were trying to make a website about yourself that displayed random quotes
		from the lord of the rings that you could use as a status.</p>
